# NepaliCurrencyRecognition
The model was trained to identify seven different nepali currency notes. At least 2000 sample images of each currency from Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. 50, Rs. 100, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, i.e. of 7 classes were taken and the model was trained on those data. Convolutional Neural Network was the approach taken for image classification. Categorical cross entropy is a cost function that is used and Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer is used for optimization technique.
